# burger
This application allows you to create a list of burgers to be eaten! The user will enter a new burger and submit it. It will be listed in yellow as a burger that is ready to be eaten. When the user clicks on the burger it will then send it to the eaten burger list. If the user clicks on it while it is in the eaten list it will delete the burger from the list! The user can add as many burgers as they would like and does not need to delete them if they do not want too. This app uses express and node on the back end to run the server and uses handlebars as an engine to deploy the front end. It uses Mysql as a database that will log all the burgers and keep track of their names and if they have been eaten. When a user deletes a burger after it has been eaten, it will delete the burger from the database. This project was created and worked on by Kevin Cowan.
